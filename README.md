Diploma Thesis on the Topic: Design of Automatic Control for Storage Cameras in a Controlled Atmosphere.
Hardware solution to control atmosphere in Food Storage cameras. Project contains mechanical, electronic and programming parts. Therefore:
  - The diploma thesis develops a system for monitoring and controlling the parameters of the controlled atmosphere in storage chambers.
  - The system uses sensors to measure levels of CO₂, O₂, ethanol, temperature, and humidity, which are connected to an Arduino microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the data and takes actions to maintain optimal conditions in the storage chambers.
  - The program code provides continuous measurement of sensor values and compares them with predefined threshold values for each chamber.
  - A Nextion touch display is used for data visualization, where CO₂, O₂, temperature, humidity, and ethanol values are displayed in separate text fields for each chamber.
  - The system ensures reliable monitoring and control of the controlled atmosphere parameters in the storage chambers.
  - The system can be expanded and adapted to the specific needs and requirements of the storage industry.
  - A laboratory model of the system has been created.
Technologies used: **Arduino C, Nextion Display UI Software, ThingSpeak (for online monitoring), Arduino MEGA 2560, MQ sensors, ESP32-DevkitV1, Nextion Discovery Touch Display, 3D Printing Software CURA, CAD Software SOLIDWORKS CAD**
