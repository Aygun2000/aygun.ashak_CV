### Master's Diploma Thesis: Electronic and Hybrid Voting System for University Use. Specifically made for Technical University of Sofia
Developed a secure and modular web-based platform tailored for conducting electronic elections and polls within a university setting.

- Designed and implemented a system for creating, modifying, and managing elections and polls for students and administrators.

- Integrated blockchain principles to ensure data immutability and traceability of each vote.

- Applied HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) for vote authentication and tamper protection.

- Supported both anonymous and verifiable voting with receipt-based verification.

- Enabled QR-based login and optional 2FA to improve user identification and access control.

- Built a role-based access system with separate interfaces for users and administrators.

- Implemented buffering and resynchronization logic for vote recovery in case of connection loss.

- Developed using PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS/JS, with secure backend logic and frontend integration.

- Included audit logs, vote chain verification, and token-based transparency for election integrity.

**Technologies Used**: **PHP, MySQL, HTML/CSS/JavaScript, VSCode, Git**

### Kotlin-Based Android App: FocusGuard
Designed and developed a mobile productivity application that encourages focused work by restricting access to distracting apps during user-defined focus sessions.
Due to Android 10+ restrictions, I implemented a PIN-based workaround to maintain app-blocking functionality.
- Implemented a foreground service using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose to maintain persistent focus sessions.

- Monitored active applications in real-time using the UsageStatsManager API, with logic to detect and block blacklisted apps (e.g., social media or browsers).

- Enforced app blocking by launching a custom full-screen activity or showing a high-priority notification when restricted apps are opened.

- Integrated coroutine-based timers to track session duration and update the UI and notification system dynamically.

- Handled background activity limitations introduced in Android 14 (BAL restrictions) with fallback mechanisms and user-aware alerts.

- Created a configurable blacklist system and app state management logic to ensure adaptability and user control.

- Built with Jetpack libraries, Hilt for dependency injection, and Room for potential future session tracking.

- Developed and tested on Android 12–14, ensuring backward compatibility and performance stability.

**Technologies Used**: **Kotlin, Jetpack Compose, Hilt, Room, Android SDK, VSCode, Git**
